				<h1>Responding to Welsh language need</h1>
				<p>Responding to Welsh language need communicating in the individual's language of choice is an important factor to consider when planning and providing excellent care. In Wales, legislation means that public bodies, and in some cases organisations providing services on behalf of public bodies, have specific duties with regard to the Welsh language.</p>
				<p>More than just Words, the Welsh Government Framework for Welsh language in health and social care sets out good practice standards including the concept of the 'active offer' of services in Welsh, i.e. moving the responsibility from the person to ask for services through the medium of Welsh, to the service to make the offer. This is because individuals requiring care and support are often vulnerable and not confident or able to ask for services in Welsh. You should know your organisationâ€™s legal responsibilities in relation to Welsh language provision.</p>
				<p>You should work with your employer to design and implement appropriate policies, including recruitment. You should support staff to develop and use their Welsh language skills, as appropriate.</p>
