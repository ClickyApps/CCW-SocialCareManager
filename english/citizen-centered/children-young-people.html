				<h1>Children and young people</h1>
				<p>5 The Human Rights Act 1998 applies to children and young people and adults. There are associated United Nations conventions and protocols for specific groups (see paragraph 10). If you are working with children and young people, it is essential that you fully recognise their distinct needs and specific rights that may be different to those that apply to adults. In particular, you must familiarise yourself with and apply the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) to your practice and support staff to do the same. This is in order for children and young people receiving services to get the support they need to enjoy the levels of well-being experienced by their peers, and in order that their rights under the UNCRC are realised.</p>
 				<p>The seven Core Aims developed by Welsh Government summarise the UNCRC and form the basis for decisions on priorities and objectives nationally. They should also form the basis for decisions on strategy, service provision and practice locally. The seven Core Aims are that children and young people:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><span>have a flying start in life</span></li>
					<li><span>have a comprehensive range of education and learning opportunities</span></li>
					<li><span>enjoy the best possible health and are free from abuse, victimisation and exploitation</span></li>
					<li><span>have access to play, leisure, sporting and cultural activities</span></li>
					<li><span>are listened to, treated with respect, and have their race and cultural identity recognised</span></li>
					<li><span>have a safe home and a community which supports physical and emotional wellbeing</span></li>
					<li><span>are not disadvantaged by poverty.</span></li>
				</ol>
