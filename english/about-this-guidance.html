				<h1>About this practice guidance</h1>
				<p>This practice guidance is for social care managers registered with the Social Care Wales:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span>residential child care managers</span></li>
					<li><span>adult care home managers</span></li>
					<li><span>domiciliary care managers</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>The guidance, which builds on the Code of Professional Practice for Social Care, aims to:</p>
				<ul class="clear">
					<li><span>describe what is expected of social care managers</span></li>
					<li><span>provide a practical tool, aiding social care managers in their practice</span></li>
					<li><span>provide guidance which supports social care managers to lead on the delivery of high quality, citizen centred services</span></li>
					<li><span>provide the basis on which more detailed practice guidance can be developed to support best practice.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>The guidance also contains links to other information intended to support social care managers in their practice.</p>
				<p>The Guidance has been developed with reference to the National Occupational Standards (NOS) for Leadership and Management of Care Services.</p>
				<p>This is a dynamic document which will be reviewed and updated periodically. It is not intended to cover all situations or areas of practice. Social care managers are expected to use their professional judgement, applying the general principles and the Code of Professional Practice for Social Care. Social care managers must adhere to requirements on them set out in the Care Standards Act 2000 and in statutory regulations, national minimum standards and guidance. The Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales (CSSIW) can take this guidance into account when assessing a proposed manager’s suitability for registration and also, should it be in question, the appropriateness of an existing manager’s continued registration.</p>
				<p>In this guidance the term individual is used to refer to the person the social care manager supports or cares for in their work whether that be a child, young person or adult.</p>
