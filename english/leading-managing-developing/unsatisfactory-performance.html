				<h1>Unsatisfactory performance and misconduct</h1>
				<p>You must take immediate steps to address unsatisfactory performance or misconduct by staff. In so doing you should:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Ensure a focus on the rights, safety and welfare of individuals and staff.</li>
					<li>Meet legal and regulatory requirements.</li>
					<li>Be fair and non- discriminatory.</li>
					<li>Keep clear, accurate and accessible records.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>You must do all you can to ensure that effective organisational procedures for managing unsatisfactory performance, capability and disciplinary matters are in place and are used and concluded correctly (including if the staff member leaves the organisation during the process). Similarly for raising concerns / whistleblowing.</p>
				<p>You should ensure that workers understand policies and procedures for dealing with unsatisfactory performance or misconduct. You should maintain confidentiality about any issues related to unsatisfactory performance or misconduct in line with legislative, regulatory and organisational requirements.</p>
				<p>If you are in any doubt about managing unsatisfactory performance or misconduct, you should seek appropriate advice and expertise, e.g., from Human Resources, legal services or regulatory body.</p>
				<p>You should inform the appropriate regulatory body about any unsatisfactory performance or misconduct by a registered professional that might call into question their registration. This includes informing the Care Council for Wales about any unsatisfactory performance or misconduct by a registered social care worker.</p>
