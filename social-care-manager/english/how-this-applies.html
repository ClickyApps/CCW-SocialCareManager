				<h1>How this guidance applies to you</h1>
				<p>The Guidance is addressed primarily to registered Social Care Managers. It is also relevant to those working in deputy or assistant manager roles. Prospective managers can use the guidance to inform them of the work they would be taking on. It is relevant to employers and can be used to assess whether appropriate arrangements are in place to ensure professional, citizen centred and safe practice. It can be used to let individuals, relatives, carers and the public know what they can expect from Social Care Managers. It is the Social Care Manager's responsibility to be familiar with the Guidance and to follow the guidance it contains. Social Care Managers must use their judgement to apply the guidance to different situations.</p>
				<p>The Code of Professional Practice for Social Care sets out standards that may be taken into account by the Care Council in considering allegations of misconduct or  impaired fitness to practise. The Guidance in this document may be used to illustrate a  potential failure to uphold the standards in the Code by a Social Care Manager. Serious or persistent failure to follow this guidance may, therefore, put your registration at risk.</p>
				<p>In the Guidance the terms ‘you must’ and ‘you should’ are used in the following ways:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span>'You must' is an overriding principle.</span></li>
					<li><span>'You should' is used when providing an explanation of how you will meet an overriding principle.</span></li>
					<li><span>'You should' is also used where the principle will not apply in all situations, or where there are factors outside your control that affect how you can follow the guidance.</span></li>
				</ul>
